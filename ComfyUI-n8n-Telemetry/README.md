# ComfyUI-n8n-Telemetry 🚀

A high-performance background telemetry plugin for ComfyUI. This official plugin intercepts native ComfyUI events and sends clean JSON payloads to an n8n Webhook whenever a generation starts, finishes, or fails.

It operates completely in the background without needing any nodes on your workflow canvas, making it a "set and forget" solution. It ensures zero latency impact on your generations.

## ✨ Features

- **No Canvas Clutter**: Operates entirely in the background. No custom nodes required on the ComfyUI canvas!
- **UI Configuration**: Easily set the n8n Webhook URL via the ComfyUI Settings menu (⚙️).
- **Headless Mode Support**: Configuration is saved to the backend, so it works flawlessly even when triggering prompts via API without opening the browser.
- **High Performance**: HTTP POST requests are sent on separate threads to ensure ComfyUI's main generation thread is never blocked.
- **n8n Ready**: Includes a pre-configured n8n workflow template.
